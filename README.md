# Mac Souce Ports Extractor

&nbsp;

This app allows you to extract the contents of GOG.com installers for Windows. It essentially functions as a rudimentary GUI version of `innoextract`. 

Right now it can do exactly two things:

- **List** the contents of an installer

- **Extract** the contents of an installer to a directory

More features may be added in the future but in the interim this serves the purpose of allowing you to extract a GOG installer without needing to use the command line.
